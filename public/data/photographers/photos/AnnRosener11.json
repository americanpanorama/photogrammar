Inappropriately dressed for a war plant job, Eunice Kimball is interviewed by Earl Metz, Bendix Aviation employment manager. Mr. Metz tells her that though her application may show her fitness for the job, her clothes are completely unfit for it. Those open-toed sandals would be no protection against falling tools or other heavy objects; her fuzzy sweater would catch in machines; and her jewelry would be a constant menace against moving machine parts. &quot;You&#39;re hired,&quot; he tells Eunice, &quot;but we&#39;ll have to put you into a safe uniform before you even enter the shop.&quot; Bendix Aviation Plant, Brooklyn, New York","year":"1943","month":"3","vanderbilt_level1":"","vanderbilt_level2":"","vanderbilt_level3":"","lot_number":"1885","city":"Brooklyn","county":"New York","state":"New York","country":"United States","longitude":"-73.9495823","latitude":"40.6501038","fips_code":"36061","img_large_path":"fsa/8b06000/8b06400/8b06435v.jpg","img_medium_path":"fsa/8b06000/8b06400/8b06435r.jpg","img_thumb_img":"fsa/8b06000/8b06400/8b06435_150px.jpg"},{"loc_item_link":"oem2002008186/PP","call_number":"LC-USE6-D-009750","photograph_type":"","photographer_name":"Ann Rosener","caption":"Safe clothes for women war workers.
