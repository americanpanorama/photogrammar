This small light truck, known officially as the &quot;Truck 1/4-ton 4x4,&quot; is a small, low-silhouette, narrow-tread, 4-wheel drive car without armor protection, which is designed to carry three men and their individual weapons. It can also be used as an ammunition carrier. It is not currently contemplated that the vehicle itself will be armed. If this vehicle proves satisfactory under the exhaustive tests now in progress, its place in the Calvalry Team will be to furnish road and cross-country transportation for small rifile units whose normal function would include reconnaissance, security and dismounted combat. Frequently these rifle units will be employed with mechanized cavalry elements, such as Scout Car platoons, to extend the reconnaissance and supplement the fire power of larger units. This newly developed 1/4-ton truck has many advantages over motorcycles and moto-tricycles: it can carry three men, where the others are designed for two; it has more cross-country ability and ruggedness than the motorcycles; it is relatively quiet; its light weight permits manhandling; it&#39;s to be employed to carry either three men or a cargo weapon; it&#39;s easily concealed.
