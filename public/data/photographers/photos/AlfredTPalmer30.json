In the background is the power house which supplies electricity and steam to turn the wheels of this important defense industry, set in the Pennsylvania hills about thirty miles north of Pittsburgh, one of America&#39;s most important steel producing centers","year":"NA","month":"NA","vanderbilt_level1":"","vanderbilt_level2":"","vanderbilt_level3":"","lot_number":"NA","city":"Brackenridge","county":"Allegheny County","state":"Pennsylvania","country":"United States","longitude":"-79.7411594","latitude":"40.6081221","fips_code":"42003","img_large_path":"fsa/8b00000/8b00400/8b00467v.jpg","img_medium_path":"fsa/8b00000/8b00400/8b00467r.jpg","img_thumb_img":"fsa/8b00000/8b00400/8b00467_150px.jpg"},{"loc_item_link":"oem2002000851/PP","call_number":"LC-USE6-D-000973","photograph_type":"","photographer_name":"Alfred T.
