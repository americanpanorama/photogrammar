With normal operations of this automobile factory suspended for the duration, the gigantic task of converting the entire plant (floor space: 500&#39; x 900&#39;) to war production was taken over by the National Defense Plant Corporation. This involved all degrees of remodelling, the removal of old and installation of new machinery, and extensive rebuilding of the plant itself. This hand milling machine, formerly used in manufacture of automobile motors, has been converted to production of airplane engines. In peacetime it was used to mill the pulley keyway on the front of crankshafts. It cost $150 to convert this $1,800 machine with installation of a special fixture to enable milling of staking nicks at each end of crankpin oil hobs.
