This plant produces the battle-tested B-25 (&quot;Billy Mitchell&quot;) bomber, used in General Doolittle&#39;s raid on Tokyo, and the P-51 (&quot;Mustang&quot;) fighter plane, which was first brought into prominence by the British raid on Dieppe","year":"1942","month":"10","vanderbilt_level1":"","vanderbilt_level2":"","vanderbilt_level3":"","lot_number":"1986","city":"Inglewood","county":"Los Angeles County","state":"California","country":"United States","longitude":"-118.3531311","latitude":"33.9616801","fips_code":"6037","img_large_path":"fsa/8b05000/8b05100/8b05113v.jpg","img_medium_path":"fsa/8b05000/8b05100/8b05113r.jpg","img_thumb_img":"fsa/8b05000/8b05100/8b05113_150px.jpg"},{"loc_item_link":"oem2002006045/PP","call_number":"LC-USE6-D-007537","photograph_type":"","photographer_name":"Alfred T.
