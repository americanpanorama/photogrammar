Intercontinental Rubber Producers. Two-year-old guayule plants. At two years, the guayule contains about nine percent rubber of dry weight. To supply the emergency needs for rubber, these shrubs would have to be planted closer together if a two year harvest cycle were planned. Rubber yield per acre would then closely approximate the yield from mature shrubs","year":"1941","month":"12","vanderbilt_level1":"Work","vanderbilt_level2":"Agriculture: Crops, Livestock, Ranches","vanderbilt_level3":"Guayule","lot_number":"4","city":"Salinas","county":"Monterey County","state":"California","country":"United States","longitude":"-121.6555013","latitude":"36.6777372","fips_code":"6053","img_large_path":"fsa/8c23000/8c23100/8c23122v.jpg","img_medium_path":"fsa/8c23000/8c23100/8c23122r.jpg","img_thumb_img":"fsa/8c23000/8c23100/8c23122_150px.jpg"},{"loc_item_link":"fsa2000047690/PP","call_number":"LC-USF34-070961","photograph_type":"D","photographer_name":"Russell Lee","caption":"Salinas, California.
