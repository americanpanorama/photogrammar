RICHARD DOUD: Mrs. Delano, you were mentioning that the file had never been utilized the way it should have been. What value do you, or Mr. Delano feel this file has as a file of pictures today? How could it be . . . how should it be used?

## 00:01:11
IRENE DELANO: Well, that's such a broad question because the uses of it are so infinite, really. I mean . . . well, without question just telling something about life in America in a million different aspects could be told in many different ways, either in exhibits or in books or whatnot. I think it is true that one of the weaknesses now is that not very much has been added since to bring it up-to-date. So that if you're telling a story of America, you have this big hole now. You would have to depend, I suppose, on newspapers and magazines for later material.

## 00:02:10
RICHARD DOUD: Well, one of the faults I've found with the way it's been used, and I think "The Bitter Years," in spite of the fact that it was really a fine exhibit, was that the emphasis has always been on really the down-and-out poverty, the misery of the country in the Thirties. As far as I'm concerned, this shows only one small aspect of the Farm Security file and I've always been interested in exhibits or publications of some kind that would show the diversity of the material, types of material. I think it is important, too, to show the multiplicity of certain types of evidence. I'm thinking in terms of numbers of photographers who have covered the same kinds of material. How often is one subject treated in the file? If it is treated a great number of times, perhaps then that gives this one aspect an outstanding importance in America in the 1930's -- a varied type of coverage like this. Not only the range but the various intensities of coverage of the photographs themselves. If there is any way that this could be reasonably done, I'd certainly like to get some ideas on it.

## 00:03:50
JACK DELANO: Well, I think it is a great shame that the project didn't continue, of course, because, as Irene said, there were a certain number of years during which we were all working, and then it all stopped. What in the files represents the work of those years. After that there isn't anything. But think of what has been happening in the United States since 1945, since the War, after the War, the transformation and all kinds of social movements that have been happening in the United States since the War. This would have driven Roy mad, insane to cover all this. I mean, our whole . . . if nothing more than our attitude toward science and space and the effect that it has had on the whole country, just as one symbolic thing, one example. What's been happening in education in the United States in ten years is another example of compete revolution in thinking about all these things which reflects itself in attitudes and human behavior; and in a way the industrial revolution in the United States after the War with plastics and transistor radios, computers, and all of these things. These are the things that have been changing in American life since the War. These are the kinds of things that properly would be fields in which the project would be working -- in which we would all be working. Well, nobody has been except as reflected in newspaper stories and other things which are in somebody's file somewhere about the country but never from this point of view of the project. I'm just saying this because I think it's tragic that the project did just simply cut off and stop when the country didn't stop and all the things that we were looking at didn't stop. They continued developing in an extraordinary way. But your question about how the file could be used . . . I remember Roy was not only a collector of photographs, but he collected all kinds of things, including people, and Alice collected buttons, but Roy -- this collector's attitude and this idea that everything is useful and you've got to have it, and if you don't need it now, you'll need it later, or somebody else is going to need it. This was something that he was always impressing on us, too. Roy had a great admiration for Sears, Roebuck catalogues, for example. He felt that they should be kept and that they were very valuable -- Sears, Roebuck or Montgomery Ward's catalogue of thirty or forty years ago is an extraordinary historical document of what dress was like at that time, and appliances, and automobiles and parts, and all kinds of things. In the same way, the file will be valuable as the years go by, in this same sense also. Even now it is valuable in that sense because of the material contained in it about social mores of the time, about . . . well, things have changed already considerably just in these twenty-odd years and the files gives us such a vivid picture of what things were like at that time, not only in the depressed areas but in all the other things we covered.

## 00:08:05
IRENE DELANO: Well, and talking about the depressed areas and all that, I think it is very important to say that if the file photographers had been equally interested in every aspect of American life, we would have had such a diverse thing that we wouldn't have had these great photographs. I think that it was important that the emphasis was on the problems of the time.

## 00:08:29
RICHARD DOUD: Sure.

## 00:08:30
IRENE DELANO: And the fact that the photographers did feel that they were doing something that maybe would help these things. That's what makes good work. I mean if you're just going out with the idea that you're photographing American life in a broad sense, then -- and you don't have any personal commitment . . . . When somebody is in trouble, you have a personal commitment to help them and I think that that is the feeling that this file gives. It is true that it doesn't show every aspect of American life. It shows a great deal more of rural life than urban life because it was a Farm Security project. It shows more of problem areas than non-problem areas -- that's what we were trying to do.

## 00:09:12
JACK DELANO: It was the temper of the times.

## 00:09:15
IRENE DELANO: Temper of the times, and because it was the important thing and it was because of that . . . I mean, that is not a weakness of the file, that's the strength of the file. I don't agree with you. Unless you have that feeling of commitment to something that you're trying to make something better, no matter what it is, then you are not going to have a Farm Security file. The reason the Farm Security file is good is because the people thought they were making it better. They were trying to help something that was bad, and to me that's very important. I disagree with the attitude of criticism of the file because it was so one-sided. I don't think that it could have been as good a file if it had tried to show all aspects of every situation. I mean . . . .

## 00:10:07
JACK DELANO: It is true that we had this kind of dedication, but we also had another kind of dedication which is broader than that. We weren't thinking that we were making anything better or improving a lot of poor people when we were photographing those beautiful barns in New England or the beautiful picket fences or the rolling countryside or the county fairs or lots of these other things.

## 00:10:33
RICHARD DOUD: He is sort of pointing up what I was trying to say a minute ago. I don't feel that the Farm Security file is that one-sided, but I do think that that's the impression that has been given.

## 00:10:45
IRENE DELANO: Yes.

## 00:10:47
RICHARD DOUD: It is one-sided in a sense that it is primarily rural or small town -- it is one-sided in that aspect. But it is not one-sided in the fact that it's a documentation, let's say, of human misery. It has human misery in it. There is no doubt. But it has a lot of things in it. I've gone through a good bit of it in the last few months and I keep thinking of things like -- you mentioned county fairs, the girlie shows and the gals are all out trying to attract customers and it would show political signs on the highway. There is one in Connecticut, a guy running for Congress, and he says, "I will vote no on any bill that calls for raising taxes." This type of thing. It's really a pretty broad statement and I don't think that we're given that impression by the way the file has been used. I think there must be a better way to do it. It is a tremendous group of photographs. I think in a way they are blaspheming the value by not using them properly. I would be interested in ideas on how to get more out of it. How to make people more aware of what's in it and encouraging people to use it. There is all sorts of sociological material there. Political material if you want to use it. Various types of cultural studies could use it just historically -- costume or customs.

## 00:12:35
IRENE DELANO: That's right.

## 00:12:36
RICHARD DOUD: This type of thing. There are things in there that people today even in their twenties have never seen and never heard of.

## 00:12:44
IRENE DELANO: I think it would be marvelous to do a . . . you could do from now until you die exhibits of all these different aspects of just what is in that file now, and booklets on all kinds of things.

## 00:12:58
JACK DELANO: That's what I was thinking of. I don't have any specific suggestions about projects with the files, but as with other museums and collections, I think sections of the file on different themes or certain subject matter would be wonderful things for booklets -- a series. You mentioned county fairs; well, there is a wealth of material there on county fairs from Maine to Southern California.

## 00:13:25
RICHARD DOUD: I'd like to see educational people use it more.

## 00:13:28
IRENE DELANO: Did you see that one thing?

## 00:13:30
RICHARD DOUD: I did. I was talking to Mr. Delano about that earlier and I thought it was . . . .

## 00:13:33
IRENE DELANO: It was just like a breath of fresh air to see.

## 00:13:36
RICHARD DOUD: Tremendously well-handled as far as I was concerned. Again, it showed agrarian distress, but it does show what can be done with still photography, this kind of material. So I'm all for any ideas on how this type of material could be used; but if the impressions persist that it is only this, then it will be very difficult to get people to use it.

## 00:14:07
JACK DELANO: Incidentally, there is a lot of humor in the file.

## 00:14:10
IRENE DELANO: Oh, yes.

## 00:14:11
RICHARD DOUD: That's what John Collier says.

## 00:14:12
IRENE DELANO: Yes, a tremendous amount, it's true.

## 00:14:15
RICHARD DOUD: But who would believe it after "The Bitter Years?"

## 00:14:21
JACK DELANO: I was just thinking of one of my own pictures, the one that Stryker used so much.

## 00:14:27
IRENE DELANO: That was in the . . . .

## 00:14:28
JACK DELANO: "Family of Man" show -- of the farmer hitching up his pants and laughing and his wife laughing. Do you remember that one?

## 00:14:37
IRENE DELANO: No, I don't believe I do. The tobacco farmer in Connecticut?

## 00:14:46
RICHARD DOUD: Well, we've sort of talked around a lot of things. Are there any points that we should cover that we haven't?

## 00:14:54
JACK DELANO: I think this might be an appropriate time to take a break and hunt for the . . . .

## 00:14:58
RICHARD DOUD: All right. We'll let you think about it some more.

## 00:14:59
IRENE DELANO: I wish to the devil we could find that . . . .
