      "Born in 1915 and raised in New York City, Rothstein’s interest in photography flourished as a teenager. Along with a home darkroom, he exhibited his photos in local salons. With the intention of pursuing a career in medicine, Rothstein attended Columbia University. He continued to pursue his hobby by founding the University Camera Club and serving as the yearbook’s photography editor. His extracurricular activity soon became his career. His work on a pictorial record of agriculture with economists [Roy Stryker] (/photographers/RoyStryker) and Rexford Tugwell soon lead to a position with the New Deal. He followed the two men to D.C. when Stryker offered him a job in 1935 with the Historical Section. As one of the first staff photographers, he helped guide the visual and political directions for the unit alongside colleagues such as [Ben Shahn] (/photographers/BenShahn), [Carl Mydans] (/photographers/CarlMydans), and [Dorothea Lange] (/photographers/DorotheaLange) as well as helped set-up the infrastructure such as the the photo laboratory alongside Russell Lee (/photographers/RussellLee). In addition to taking several of the most iconic images such as the dust bowl and Gee’s Bend [link], he became known for his photo essays, an emerging genre of documentary and journalism.",
      "Following his tenure at the Historical Section, he took a position in 1940 as a staff photographer at *Look*, a biweekly magazine known for pioneering the use of photo essays. After a year, he left to serve as a photographer in the US Signal Corps during World War II followed by a position with the United Nations in China. He returned to *Look* in 1947, rising to the position of Director of Photography, and remained with the publication until 1971, when the magazine shuttered. Along with a stint at *Parade*, he was an avid teacher. In addition to his faculty positions at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism among other institutions, he mentored photographers such as Stan Kubrik and wrote several books on photography. Honors include one-person exhibitions, numerous photojournalism awards, and a position as a juror for the Pulitzer Prize. He died on November 11, 1985 in New Rochelle, New York."

      "Born in Kaunas, Russia (now Lithuania) on September 12, 1989, Ben Shahn immigrated with his family to Brooklyn, New York, in 1906. After a few years studying biology at New York University, in 1921 he enrolled in City College to study the arts and continued his studies at the National Academy of Design. His acclaimed career in the arts began with lithographic work followed by a focus on painting, which would become the medium that earned him his reputation as a left-wing social realist artist. Building off the success of his work *The Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti*, he worked briefly in 1933 as muralist Diego Rivera’s assistant, and began working for the Public Works of Art Project, a New Deal program.  Mentorship from his friend Helen Levitt and his roommate [Walker Evans] (/photographers//WalkerEvans), helped him to refine his photography, and Roy Stryker hired him in 1935. He was one of the first photographers to join the Historical Section on a regular salary. He is known for his images taken through a right-angle viewfinder on his Leica camera, which enabled capturing images without drawing the attention of the people being photographed.",
      "Shahn remained with the Historical Section until 1938, when, upon receiving a mural commission in the Bronx with his wife, painter Bernarda Bryson Shahn, he returned to painting and did not work in photography again. But, like many of his colleagues in the Historical Section, Shahn also found himself working for OWI during World War II, where he designed posters.  Soon after the war ended, he added to his political engagement the role of city councilman in Roosevelt, New Jersey, where he lived alongside fellow Historical Section photographers and friends [Edwin] (/photographs/EdwinRosskam) and [Louise Rosskam] (/photographers/LouiseRosskam). His art career also continued to flourish, including work for *Time* and *Fortune* and major exhibitions such as a solo show at the Museum of Modern Art. He died on March 14, 1969 in New York City."

      "Born May 20, 1907 in Boston, Massachusetts, Mydans studied at Boston University’s School of Journalism. At the time, his main tool was the typewriter. His work with the student paper led to reporting jobs with the *Boston Globe* and *Boston Herald*. In 1931, Mydan moved to New York to join the reporting staff of *American Banker*, a daily trade magazine for the financial industry. His freelance work further convinced him of the power of images to tell impactful stories, so he bought one of the then-new 35mm cameras, honed his photography skills, and began his transition to photojournalism. In 1935, Mydans moved to Washington D.C. to work for the Historical Section. As one of the section's first salaried photographers, he brought a foundational journalistic approach to the unit and he became knownn for his images that compassionately conveyed the suffering of the Great Depression, particularly among rural communities in the American South.",
      "While Mydans was close to [Roy Stryker] (/photographers/RoyStryker), he was actually recommnended by  *Time* editor Daniel Longwell and hired by Robert Thorpe, to assist him in making a book about surburban resettlement. Often compared to acclaimed war photographer Robert Capa, Mydans took photographs while on assignment abroad during World War II that earned him international recognition. The experience also resulted in his becoming a prisoner of war in Japan and then China along with his wife Shelley Smith Mydans, an accomplished journalist and writer also working for *Life*. Neither was deterred by the experience, however, and Mydans remained with the now acclaimed photography weekly for the 36 year run of the magazine. Further assginments followed with major outlets such as *Time* and *Smithsonian*. Along with major exhibitions and books, Mydans' honors included the U.S. Camera Magazine's Gold Achievement Award. He died in Larchmont, N.Y. in August 2004."

Having experienced unemployment and participated in hunger marches, Jung developed a deep concern for everyday people.  His aesthetic was shaped by his attention to American and European politics, his own experiences living in Chicago, and his interest in social documentary photographers such as Eugène Atget.",
      "After spending time at Vienna’s Graphische Lehr- und Versuchsanstalt, he returned to the United States in the midst of the Great Depression and moved to Washington D.C. for a job within the Federal Emergency Relief Administration drafting charts of unemployment statistics. His photographs and his sensibility captured the attention of Roy Stryker, who hired Jung in 1934, but difficulties with technique hampered his employment as a photographer.  Nevertheless, he would remain with the unit until 1943, working on administrative tasks such as writing photo captions and designing pamphlets.  Afterwards, he pursued a career in areas such as advertising and book illustration and design, and worked as a graphic designer for groups such as the Consumers Council. He died on February 19, 1996 in California."

      "Born in Munich, Germany, in 1903 to American parents, Rosskam moved back to the United States shortly after the First World War. Shaped by his experience as a civil prisoner of war and of losing his father in Germany, he turned to the arts. After a year at Haverford College, he matriculated and graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia. While he enjoyed success as a painter, photography became his expressive mode of choice. The shift came during his time in Paris in the late 1920s, with what became known as “The Lost Generation,” where he received photography lessons from Man Ray. He traveled extensively, taking photographs for european press outlets before returning to the United States during the Great Depression. He married [Louise Rosenbaum Rosskam] (/photographers/LouiseRosskam),in 1936, and his wife joined him at the *Philadelphia Record*, beginning what would turn into over four decades of personal and professional collaborations.",
      "Rosskam’s freelance work brought him into contact with [Roy Stryker] (/photographers/RoyStryker), who hired Edwin in 1938 because of his expertise in designing layouts for picture stories.  He left after a year, in July 1940, but then returned in 1941 and remained for two more years. Taking photos was secondary to his primary role, which was to design exhibitions that were sent across the United States. He also selected photographs for publications such as *Time* and Sherwood Anderson’s *Home Town*. Among his most prominent projects, which was completed during his brief hiatus from the Historical Section, was *Twelve Million Black Voices*.  The book paired images from the File selected by Rosskam with the writing of renowned author Richard Wright.  After working with the Historical Section, the Rosskams joined Stryker in 1943 at Standard Oil alongside [Esther Bubley] (/photographers/EstherBubley), [John Collier] (/photographers/JohnCollier), [Russell Lee] (/photographers/RussellLee), [Gordon Parks] (/photographers/GordonParks), and [John Vachon] (/photographers/JohnVachon). In 1945, the Rosskams moved to Puerto Rico to start a documentary project modeled on the Historical Section’s File. After living for several years in Puerto Rico, they moved back to the United States where they lived in Roosevelt, New Jersey, alongside [the Shahns] (/photographers/BenShahn). They continued to work in the arts and raised their two daughters. Edwin Rosskam died on February 25, 1985."

Following the death of his mother, 14-year-old Parks moved to St. Paul, Minnesota to live with his sister and her husband. Purchasing his first camera at age 25, Park’s fashion photos quickly caught the attention of local businesses and their clientele. With the support of Marva Louis, the wife of the heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis, Parks and his wife opened a portrait studio in Chicago in 1940. While Parks took photos of society women in the studio, he created powerful depictions of everyday Black life in urban America under segregation. The work earned him a Julius Rosenwald Fellowship in 1942 and led to a job in the Historical Section. While [Stryker] (/photographers/RoyStryker) would remain cautious about how the images circulated, Park’s photographs drew on his background in portraiture and lived experiences of racism and poverty to create some of the most iconic images of the era.

      "Marion Post Wolcott was born in New Jersey on June 7, 1910.  Her interest in the arts was fueled by the vibrant creative communities in Greenwich Village. Along with studying modern dance, she studied early childhood education at New School for Social Research and New York University,, graduating in 1927. Her teaching position in a Masschusettes mill village ended with the school’s closure due to the Great Depression, whereupon she moved to Paris and then to Vienna to continue pursuing her interest in art. While in Vienna she discovered photography and the support of the highly respected female portrait photographer Trude Fleischmann stoked her interest.  She also experienced first hand the rising tide of facism. She returned to the United States in 1934. Her early teaching experiences along with the violence of Nazi Germany cemented her commitment to political and social issues.",
      "After securing a new teaching position in New York, she continued to refine her craft by taking photographs, attending lectures at the Photo League, and circulating within avant garde documentary circles. Like her future colleague [Marjory Collins] (/photographers/MarjoryCollins), she was mentored by Ralph Steiner. Her experience as a freelancer with magazines such as *Fortune* led to a position as a staff photographer in 1937 at the *Philadelphia Evening Bulletin*, where the era's sexism was on full display. Steiner and another mentor, acclaimed photographer Paul Strand, encouraged Stryker to hire Marion Post at the Historical Section. He did so in 1938, making her the first full time salaried female photographer on the unit.  While she did not shy away from portraying the challenges of the depression, her work at the FSA is noted for its focus on middle class life, thereby bringing greater complexity to the socioeconomic depiction of the era. Wolcott left her employment in Washington DC in February 1942, shortly after marrying Lee Wolcott, an administrator at the Department of Agriculture and a widower with small children. While she continued to take photographs, it became secondary to her role raising her children and teaching. All her work for the FSA was re-labeled with her married name, Wolcott.  Upon moving to California in 1968 she returned to freelance photography and, with renewed attention to her achievements, came invitations to exhibit regularly. Awards included the Dorothea Lange Award from the Oakland Museum in 1986 and the Sprague Award from the National Press Photographers’ Association in 1990. She died on November 24, 1990."

      "Born on March 15, 1915, to a socially prominent family, Marjory Collins grew up outside New York City in Westchester County. After attending the Brearley School, Sweet Briar College and the University of Munich, and after an early marriage and divorce, she moved to Greenwich Village in 1935. Drawn to photography, she studied informally with acclaimed avant garde documentarian Ralph Steiner, who also mentored [Marion Post Wolcott] (/photographers/MarionPostWolcott). Her career as a documentary photographer flourished as she worked for magazines such as *PM*, and major photo agencies such as Black Star represented her work alongside the work of her future colleague [Andreas Feininger] (/photographers/AndreasFeininger). Her story about Hoboken, New Jersey for *U.S. Camera* in 1941 led to an offer from the Office of War Information. After several months in the New York Office, she moved to D.C. in January 1942. While her photographs would amplify government narratives of a harmonious and strong nation banning together for world war, her simultaneous willingness to depict the more sordid sides of the country would gain her critics but also a more nuanced visual record of the era beyond propaganda.",
      "Following the OWI, while her personal life remained fraught she enjoyed significant professional success as a freelance photographer. Her work for the U.S. government and commercial press brought her primarily to Europe and Africa. As editing and writing became a larger part of her repertoire, she settled in Vermont, worked for publications such as the *Journal of Public Health*, and worked for social causes such as the civil rights and the feminist movements. She founded *Prime Time* in 1971 to address issues faced by older women in society, a topic that would also become the subject of her thesis in American Studies from Antioch College. She moved in the 1980s to San Francisco, where she earned her M.A. She died in 1985."

      "Born in Detroit  in 1913, Arthur Siegel’s interest in photography bloomed before college. He received his B.A in sociology from Wayne State University in 1936, where he also worked for the university as a teacher of photography.  A year after graduation, he received a scholarship to study photography with acclaimed artist László Moholy-Nagy and his acolyte Gyorgy Kepes at the New Bauhaus: American School of Design (today known as the IIT Institute of Design) in Chicago. The aesthetics of the Bauhaus school of art would leave a lasting impression on his photography. Siegel continued to forge his career in photography as a freelancer for major magazines such as *Colliers*, *Fortune*, and  *Life* in the late 1930s.",
      "A part time job with the FSA turned into full time employment when the unit joined the Office of War Information in 1942. He was among the small group of FSA photographers given special access to a new color film called kodachrome, that would revolutionize photography. After the FSA and a brief stint with the US Army Air Corps, he returned to work with Moholy-Nagy at the Institute of Design, and led their photography program for three years. His experience at the intersection of documentary and the aesthetics of modernism would shape his pioneering work in color photography. Recognitions included a one-man show in fall 1952 at the Art Institute of Chicago, which was their first show of color photographs made up entirely of dye transfers. After two decades of commercial and experimental work, he returned yet again to his mentor’s institution in 1967 as a professor and took the reins of the photography department. He died in 1978."

      "Russell Lee was born on July 21, 1903 in Ottawa, Illinois, and orphaned by age 10.  Throughout the rest of his childhood, he moved regularly to live with relatives.  He received a chemical engineering degree from Lehigh University in 1925, but soon after, he switched paths. His wife, Doris Lee, was a painter of the American scene, and her network of artists included Diego Rivera. These connections instilled in him an interest in the arts. After an unsuccessful foray into painting, he turned to the camera. The technical process of making pictures tapped into his formal education as an engineer, while the ways of seeing through the viewfinder aligned with his interest in the visual arts. Upon viewing Lee’s portfolio of photographs depicting the challenges of everyday life under the Great Depression, Stryker hired him as a staff photographer in 1936. He would stay with the Historical Section until 1943. Among his most noted assignments is Japanese internment during World War II and color photographs of a desert, homesteader community in [Pie Town, New Mexico] (/city/NM_Pie Town#mapview=cities). He is also credited with pioneering the use of flash for indoor photography.",
      "From 1943 to 1947, Lee continued to take photographs for different units of the US federal government. Assignments included documenting air strips used during World War II and the effects of mining bituminous coal.  After the war, Lee would pursue a career in photography for the next four decades. After the war, Lee would pursue a career in photography for the next four decades, including a stint at Standard Oil with Roy Stryker alongside Historical Section colleagues [Esther Bubley] (/photographers/EstherBubley), [John Collier] (/photographers/JohnCollier), [Russell Lee] (/photographers/RussellLee), [Gordon Parks] (/photographers/GordonParks), [Louise] (/photographers/LouiseRosskam) and [Edwin Rosskam] (/photographers/EdwinRosskam), and [John Vachon] (/photographers/JohnVachon). Eventually he moved to Austin, Texas with his family, and freelanced.  In 1965, he became a photography instructor at the University of Texas-Austin. He died on August 28, 1986."

      "Born to a well to do family on November 3, 1908, in St. Louis, Missouri, Evans grew up in Chicago, Toledo, and New York City. Following a year at Williams College, he moved back to New York City and then to Paris to pursue his interest in literature. While he had made snapshots in his youth, poetry was his first ambition, and photography had remained a hobby until he moved back to New York City in 1927 and traded in the writer’s pen for a camera. Evans was inspired by the work of Eugène Atget that he had seen in Paris. Socializing in  artistic circles in the East Village, Evans shared a studio with  [Ben Shahn] (/photographers/BenShahn) and became friends with Lincoln Kirstein, whose support soon helped him find outlets for his photographs. Ernestine Evans, a friend of Ben Shahn and Walker Evans (and not related to Walker), was helping [Roy Stryker] (/photographers/RoyStryker) set-up the Historical Section. At her urging, Evans met with Stryker and joined the section in 1935. While Stryker and Evans' relationship would sour, Evans credited the experience with giving him the time and resources to refine his craft and develop his own style. The  images of rural life and vernacular architecture that he created during his time on the section contributed to his reputation as one of the most celebrated documentary photographers of the 20th century.",
      "In 1936, he took a leave to work with James Agee on an assignment for *Fortune* that was to employ some of his FSA images. When the outlet turned the project down, they published *Let Us Now Praise Famous Men*, which continues to garner praise and critique for their genre-bending fine grained depiction of three White Alabama sharecropping families. His budding reputation in fine art photography blossomed with a 1938 solo show at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) as well as the accompanying book *American Photographs*, which demonstrated how the photography book could be a work of art itself. The opportunity to work with *Time*, and he joined the staff full time in 1945. He soon returned to *Fortune*, where he remained until 1965, when he joined the Graphic Design faculty at the Yale University School of Art, to teach photography. Honors included Guggenheim Fellowships and a retrospective at MOMA in 1971. He died on April 10, 1975 in New Haven, Connecticut."

      "Born in a suburb of New York City in 1913, John Collier, Jr., spent most of his childhood and early adulthood in the California bay area and Taos, New Mexico.  His prominent father, John Collier, a sociologist, served as Commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs from 1933 to 1945.  Due to learning disabilities and hearing loss resulting from a car accident at age 8, John Collier, Jr., was homeschooled. His mother Lucy’s generous attention to his education would shape his own teaching philosophy, while the time he spent with the indigenous communities in Taos would forge his belief in the power of nonverbal culture and communication. His early forays into the arts were supported by his family’s network among the political and cultural elite. Among his mentors was painter and family friend Maynard Dixon, which also resulted in a friendship with his then wife, [Dorothea Lange] (/photographers/DorotheaLange). After a brief stint at the California School of Fine Arts, Collier shifted focus to photography. He moved in 1939 to Taos,  and used Paul Strand’s old darkroom as his studio. While he was economically unsuccessful, the year in Taos allowed him time to develop his skill.",
      "Returning to San Francisco in 1940, he worked commercial jobs and submitted his portfolio to [Stryker] (/photographers/RoyStryker) and the Historical Section. He was hired in 1941 and remained with the organization until it ended. When Stryker left for Standard Oil, John Collier, Jr.,  went too, along with [Esther Bubley] (/photographers/EstherBubley), [John Collier] (/photographers/JohnCollier), [Russell Lee] (/photographers/RussellLee), [Gordon Parks] (/photographers/GordonParks), [Louise] (/photographers/LouiseRosskam) and [Edwin Rosskam] (/photographers/EdwinRosskam), and [John Vachon] (/photographers/JohnVachon). Following his time at Standard Oil, Collier and his wife Mary E. T. Collier became pioneers of visual anthropology. Their work included collaborations with anthropologist Anbial Buitron in Ecuador among the Otavalo community, photographic studies in New Mexico and Peru, and the groundbreaking book, and concept, of *Visual Anthropology: Photography As Research Method* (1967). In 1959, they moved to San Francisco where Collier returned to California School of Fine Arts as a teacher. In 1961, he would also join the Anthropology faculty at San Francisco State University. His lasting impact is exemplified by the John Collier Jr. Award for Still Photography from the Society of Visual Anthropology. He died in 1992 in Costa Rica."

      "Born on May 26, 1895 in Hoboken, New Jersey, Lange moved with her mother and brother to New York City’s Lower East Side at age 12. Uninterested in formal schooling, she began her education in photography by reading in the public library.  Subsequently, she picked up the camera and began apprenticing with acclaimed photographer Arnold Genthe, and soon she stopped her studies at a local teacher's college. In 1918, she moved to California where she became enmeshed with the bohemian cultural elite, joined the San Francisco Camera Club, married painter Maynard Dixon, and quickly earned a reputation as a portrait photographer for a wealthy clientele. Galvanized by the Great Depression, however, she increasingly turned away from the studio to photograph deteriorating social conditions, beginning a major shift to social documentary photography.  Economist Paul Taylor of the University of California at Berkeley noticed her work and she began to work alongside him for the California State Emergency Relief Administration, illuminating the need for better living conditions for migrant workers. Her partnership with Taylor would also become personal for the two married in 1935 and would continue to work together for decades.",
      "Lange’s skill at documenting the human effects of the depression earned her wide acclaim. When her photos were featured in *Survey Graphic*, they caught the attention of [Roy Stryker] (/photographers/RoyStryker) in Washington, D.C., who hired her for the Historical Section, for which she worked from 1935 to 1939.  She continued to live in California, driving across the American southwest and south and focusing largely on the conditions and needs of migrants and tenant farmers. Lange created many of the most iconic images of the era, including Migrant Mother. In late 1939, she left the section and turned down a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship to document instead the Japanese internment camps for the War Relocation Authority.  This set of images would cement her reputation as one of the most important social documentary photographers of the 20th century. In the subsequent years, she taught photography, helped found the acclaimed photography quarterly *Aperture* in 1952, and freelanced for outlets such as  *Life*. Among her many honors was a retrospective of her work at the Museum of Modern Art, the first for a female photographer at the institution. After years of declining health, she died on October 11, 1965 in San Francisco, California, three months before the MoMA exhibition opened."

After a decade in Berlin, the family moved to Weimer, where his father became Master of the Printing Workshop at the Bauhaus school. He graduated as a cabinetmaker from the school in 1925. He continued his studies by expanding to architecture, and then to photography, thanks to the influence and mentorship of László Moholy-Nagy, who was teaching at the Bauhaus in Dessau.

      "Feininger completed a brief stint at Le Corbusier’s studio in Paris and again in Stockholm, after which, noting the rise of facism in Europe in 1939, he immigrated to the United States.  He became a freelance photographer with the Black Star Agency, a photography agency founded by German refugees that also represented [Marjory Collins] (/photographers/MarjoryCollins). He then joined the Historical Section once it had been transferred to the Office of War Information and became an architect of the unit’s World War Two propaganda aesthetic. His work earned him a staff position at  *Life* in 1943 alongside photographers such as [Gordon Parks] (/photographers/GordonParks) and [Carl Mydans] (/photographers/CarlMydans). In addition to working for the magazine for almost two decades, he became an acclaimed teacher of photography, known especially for his comprehensive photography manuals. His extensive work earned awards including the Robert Leavitt Award from the American Society of Media Photographers. He died on February 18, 1999 in New York."
